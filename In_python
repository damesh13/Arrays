#we are going to see only one dimensional arrays 
#In python to work with arrays we need to install numpy package to play with arrays
#Here i imported numpy as np for easy useage
import numpy as np

#here i created an array with help np.array
a=np.array([1,2,3,4,5])

#Toget the length  of the array we can use len function
#length= last_index+1
print(len(a))

#remember index always starts with 0 only and always last index will be size-1
print(a[0])
print(a[4])

#In arrays we have find size
#we access the elements with the help of index values
print(a[2])
print(a[3])

#To change certian value we can use index to change it
a[0]=10
print(a[0])

#In arrays we can add elements with the help of append function
a=np.append(a,6)
print(a)

#To delete the  element we use delete  function
a=np.delete(a,4)
print(a)
